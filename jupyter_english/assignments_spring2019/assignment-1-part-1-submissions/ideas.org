Should help with the months target was not active at all?




* TODO Are there any sites that the target visits that are not common in the dataset?

How can that be stored as a feature?

* TODO Any features that can be combined?

* TODO What can I do with TF-IDF?


* TODO Try another model - random forest?


* DONE Target sessions seems to be shorter than 40 seconds
Neither moved the needle too much?
