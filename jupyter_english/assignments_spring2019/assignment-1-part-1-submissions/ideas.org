* --------------------------- Medium claps count competition ---------------------------

* TODO Add time features: publication hour, whether it's morning, day, night, whether it's a weekend


* TODO stem the content and titles?

* TODO LDA to generate content topics?

* TODO K-nearest neighbors on content to generate feature / topics?

* TODO K-means on content to create groups which can be used as a feature?



* --------------------------- Website timeseries competition ---------------------------

* TODO Submit top entry, but with liblinear to compare scores

* TODO add a max_iter to the top entry lbfgs and see if it is a better score


* TODO Try increasing and decreasing the number of splits:   time_split = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=10)

* TODO For social media - instead of 5 features per site, look at all 10 sites and create a didVisitSite single feature for each site



* TODO Feature - isWeekend?




* TODO Look at the class notebooks for linear models



* DONE One hot encode the year-month category?
Seems to hurt the cross validation score?

There's a cluster of months target is more common in
Should help with the months target was not active at all?




* TODO Are there any sites that the target visits that are not common in the dataset? Or vice versa?
In other words, sites the target visits, but just about no body else does?
How can that be stored as a feature?


https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html
says "Equivalent to CountVectorizer followed by TfidfTransformer."




* TODO Any features that can be combined?

* TODO What can I do with TF-IDF?




* DONE Target sessions seems to be shorter than 40 seconds
Neither moved the needle too much?
